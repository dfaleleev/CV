These applications developed by the separate vendor were limited in functionality and required periodical system updates. As a team, we  had to find an efficient way to satisfy the needs of our customers to easily do invoice related tasks on mobile devices and simplify future feature extension. As a result, we came to a mobile-oriented SPA application with React/Redux on Client-side and ASP.Net Web Api on the server. Spa Web application performs smooth work of users on their phones and tablets, universal web platform helps us to have the same client on iOS, Android and Desktop platforms just adjusting shown information to the screen size. Extension of Web API service endpoint has another goal to extract the most used feature from the monolith web app to the set of services. It should help with a further redesign of the primary system.",

      "summary": "The business had to satisfy a client’s GDPR right to request data removal after contract termination. There were several attempts to solve this issue before, using a complicated set of SQL scripts. The database has more than 500 entity tables, so such scripts are extremely expensive in development, testing, and were brittle, so rarely survived more than one release. Due to the contract obligations timeline, we had to find another way to develop data removal scripts much faster and make it supportable in the future. I suggested a solution to use Net200 DataBee to facilitate getting identifiers of entities that belongs to a specific tenant. The team agreed with the solution and my estimations, so I took the Solution Architect role for this project. The automated approach helped us to successfully remove data in time and complete the initial goal. We transferred the framework to another team to do further data cleanup tasks.",
